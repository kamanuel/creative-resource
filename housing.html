<h2>Housing</h2>
<p>Many patients at Corner are dealing with a lack of housing or unstable housing. The social workers housed within the clinic are the best resource to help these patients navigate the housing system in Washtenaw and the surrounding counties.</p>

<h3>Referral</h3>
<p>Housing referrals are directed towards the social worker of the day (SWOD). Ultimately, the case will be handled by a case manager, but the SWOD can triage these cases appropriately.</p>
<ol>
    <li>Create a new patient case</li>
    <li>Subject: housing</li>
    <li>Description: 21 yo G1P1 being followed for hypertension. She is currently living between friends' houses and a shelter with her 3-year-old. She is seeking help with finding more stable housing.</li>
</ol>

<p>The following are common community organizations in Washtenaw County that you might hear mentioned by patients or staff:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Ozone House</li>
    <li>Avalon Housing</li>
    <li>Alpha House</li>
    <li>SafeHouse Center</li>
    <li>Delonis Center</li>
</ul>

<h3>Workflow</h3>
<p>Patient expresses need → student reports need when staffing → student initiates referral to SWOD → student or attending notifies SW about the case → notify patient about SW involvement/warm handoff</p>
